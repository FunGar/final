# final
The assignment for final assessment.

Different webdrivers can be added to the testing. ActionsFactory creates "safe clear". It was created,
because in ChromeDriver tests when the element.Clear() was used, the deleted text was still submitted,
when login button was pressed. This does not happen with CTRL + a and DELETE.
